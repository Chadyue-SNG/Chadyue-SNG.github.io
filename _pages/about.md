I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in <a href='http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/'>Department of Electronic Engineering</a>, <a href='https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html'>The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcF7N44AAAAJ&hl=en)'>Prof. Hongliang Ren</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=1vR7lMUAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Laschi Cecilia</a>. Before that, I worked as a Full-time Research Engineer Fellow affiliated with <a href='https://arc.nus.edu.sg/'>Advanced Robotics Centre (ARC)</a> from <a href='https://www.nus.edu.sg/'>National University of Singapore</a>, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=1vR7lMUAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Laschi Cecilia</a>. I earned M.S. degree in <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/'>Mechanical Engineering</a> from <a href='https://www.nus.edu.sg/'>National University of Singapore</a> in 2021, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mfH9UFIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. TAY Eng Hock, Francis</a>. During this period, I joined Medical Mechatronics Lab as a Part-time Research Assistant affiliated with <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/'>Department of Biomedical Engineering </a> from <a href='https://www.nus.edu.sg/'>National University of Singapore</a>, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcF7N44AAAAJ&hl=en)'>Prof. Hongliang Ren</a>.

My main research vision is to build autonomous dynamic tactile generation module based on multimodal fusion (vision+tactile), which enables the surgical robot to autonomously and efficiently acquire biological properties (such as tissue's elastic modulus) during operation through only millimeter-scale contact depth. In this way, I firmly believe that it safely provides the surgeon with more information through physical interaction beyond the single visual information input, creating a more immersive and comprehensive view of the surgery. Also, I am also interested and dedicated to developing inspiring and new generation of medical devices based on deployable mechanisms, origami structure, soft machines, and etc.
