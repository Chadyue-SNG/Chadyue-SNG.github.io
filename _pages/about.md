<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **YUE Wenchao**, a passionate about solving technically challenging problems that have a direct impact on medical robotics community and society. In order to acquire the required skills and technical knowledge required for it, I worked as a Full-time Research Engineer Fellow affiliated with <a href='https://arc.nus.edu.sg/'>Advanced Robotics Centre (ARC)</a> from <a href='https://www.nus.edu.sg/'>National University of Singapore</a>, supervised by <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/cecilia-laschi/'>**Prof. Laschi Cecilia**</a>, and I earned M.S. degree with distinction in <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/'>Mechanical Engineering</a> from <a href='https://www.nus.edu.sg/'>National University of Singapore</a> in 2021, supervised by <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/tay-eng-hock-francis/'>**Prof. TAY Eng Hock, Francis**</a>. During this period, I joined Medical Mechatronics Lab as a Part-time Research Assistant affiliated with <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/'>Department of Biomedical Engineering </a> from <a href='https://www.nus.edu.sg/'>National University of Singapore</a>, supervised by <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/staff/dr-ren-hongliang/'>**Prof. Hongliang Ren**</a>. While pursuing my Master degree, I quickly became aware of the enormous potential that Advanced Robotics techinique and Artificial Intelligence compution hold to improve our medical conditions and then better people's daily lives. In order to further specialize in these fields, I decided to pursue doctoral studies in <a href='http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/'>Department of Electronic Engineering</a> at <a href='https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html'> The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> in 2021, where I am currently a second-year Ph.D. Candidate, co-supervised by <a href='https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang'>**Prof. Hongliang Ren**</a> and <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/cecilia-laschi/'>**Prof. Laschi Cecilia**</a>.

My main research vision is to build autonomous dynamic tactile generation module based on multimodal fusion (vision+tactile), which enables the surgical robot to autonomously and efficiently acquire biological properties (such as tissue's elastic modulus) during operation through only millimeter-scale contact depth. In this way, I firmly believe that it safely provides the surgeon with more information through physical interaction beyond the single visual information input, creating a more immersive and comprehensive view of the surgery. Also, I am also interested and dedicated to developing inspiring and new generation of medical devices based on deployable mechanisms, origami structure, soft machines, and etc.
